When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
  I'd like to use a remote repository when collaborating on a
  project with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  There might be changes made by someone else and I might be working on my
  own changes so I wouldn't like the two to interfere.
