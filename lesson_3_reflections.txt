When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
  I'd like to use a remote repository when collaborating on a
  project with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  There might be changes made by someone else and I might be working on my
  own changes so I wouldn't like the two to interfere.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would
 you use one instead of another?
 Forks - a GitHub feature - applies to the platform.
 Clone - can be a local copy of a repository.
 Branch - a series of commits with a common ancestor.
 I would use fork when wanting to make a copy of someone else's repository
 into my GitHub account. Clone deals with a local copy on my machine. Branch
 is a concept related to a version control that helps us track new developments.
