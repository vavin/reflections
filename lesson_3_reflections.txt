When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
  I'd like to use a remote repository when collaborating on a
  project with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  There might be changes made by someone else and I might be working on my
  own changes so I wouldn't like the two to interfere.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would
 you use one instead of another?
 Forks - a GitHub feature - applies to the platform.
 Clone - can be a local copy of a repository.
 Branch - a series of commits with a common ancestor.
 I would use fork when wanting to make a copy of someone else's repository
 into my GitHub account. Clone deals with a local copy on my machine. Branch
 is a concept related to a version control that helps us track new developments.

 What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
 stored locally?
  You can access it even if you don't have an internet connection.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier,
and what would be harder?
  I would collaborate via email. Easier - it's a system that everybody knows
  how to use. Harder - it's not designed for programming projects collaborations
  so it's better to use a system that does.
