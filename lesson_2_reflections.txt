What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates a system that allows to store a history of metadata about the
changes in the project. We need to do this so we could start making changes
and submit commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
Working directory contains all the files vs. the staging area where files
are added manually. By adding a file manually, we can bundle logical changes
that were made on multiple files as a commit focusing only on them.
